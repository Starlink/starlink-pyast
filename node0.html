<h2>Introduction</h2>
This section contains an overview of PyAST and its relationship to AST.
It does not give details of the AST library itself.
<p>
<h3 id="s1">What is PyAST?</h3>
PyAST is a collection of modules that allows the facilities of the
<a href="http://www.starlink.ac.uk">Starlink</a> AST library to be used
within Python (version 2.7 or later) scripts.

<h3 id="s1">What is AST?</h3>
The <a href="http://www.starlink.ac.uk/ast">AST
library</a> provides a comprehensive range of facilities for attaching
world coordinate systems to astronomical data, for retrieving and
interpreting that information and for generating graphical output based
on it. AST is written in ANSI C but has wrappers for various other
languages, including Fortran, Java, Perl, and now Python.

<h3 id="s3">About this document:</h3>
This document does not provide a full description of the facilities of
AST, or of the AST wrapper functions provided by PyAST. For general
information about how to use AST, or the specifics of individual
functions and their parameters, the <a href="http://www.starlink.ac.uk/cgi-bin/htxserver/sun211.htx/sun211.html?xref_">
main AST documentation</a> describing the native C interface should be consulted.

<h3 id="s4">Requirements:</h3>
PyAST requires Python version 2.7 or later to be installed, and requires the
<a href="http://numpy.scipy.org/">numpy</a> package.It has no other
dependencies (a copy of the AST library itself is bundled with PyAST).
However, PyAST includes <a href="node5.html">extra optional
facilities</a> that assume the presence of other python libraries:
<ul>

<li> If the <a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/">matplotlib</A>
graphics library is available, then the
<code>starlink.Grf.grf_matplotlib</code> "GRF module" can be used with
the PyAST <code>starlink.Ast.Plot</code> class to produce annotated
coordinate grids, etc. To use any other graphics system, an equivalent
GRF module must be written.
<p>
Note, if using PyAST with Python version 3, it is necessary to use the
"<a href="https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib-py3">matplotlib for Python
 3</a>" branch.

<li> If the <a href="http://www.stsci.edu/resources/software_hardware/pyfits">
PyFITS</a> library is available, then the
<code>starlink.Atl.PyFITSAdapter</code> class provides a simple means of
transferring FITS header cards bwteeen PyFITS headers and the PyAST
<code>FitsChan</code> class.

</ul>


<h3 id="s5">Obtaining and installing PyAST:</h3>
The current version of PyAST can be downloaded from
<a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/starlink-pyast/">
PyPI</a>. To build it, unpack the tar file and then do:
<p>
<code>
% python setup.py install
</code>
<p>
To test it, do:
<p>
<code>
% python starlink/ast/test/test.py
</code>

<h3 id="s6">Using PyAST:</h3>
First import the PyAST module (starlink.Ast). For instance:
<p>
<span class=pycode>
>>> import starlink.Ast as Ast
</span>
<p>
The following is a list of general points about how to use PyAST (until
more appropriate examples are produced, the PyAST test script -
<code>starlink/ast/test/test.py</code> - can be consulted for examples of
how to use the functions provided by PyAST):

<ul>

<li> Each AST object class has a corresponding Python class (e.g. the AST
ZoomMap class corresponds to Python type starlink.Ast.ZoomMap)

<li> Each Python method name is the lower case equivalent of the corresponding
AST method name, but without the "ast" prefix (e.g. the
"<code>astTranN</code>" method becomes "<code>trann</code>" in Python).

<li> If an AST function fails, it will raise a Python Exception. Each AST
error code listed in the AST header file "ast.h" has a corresponding
subclass of Exception (e.g. the Exception subclass <code>starlink.Ast.ZOOMI</code> is
raised if an AST function returns an error code of <code>AST__ZOOMI</code>). All of
these Exception subclasses inherit from the single Exception type
<code>starlink.Ast.AstError</code>, which itself inherits from Exception.

<li> When reading the AST C documentation, remember that an AST "attribute"
is a property (i.e. an item of data) of a class instance. In the AST sense,
methods are not conisdered to be attributes of an object.

<li> In C, each AST constructor has a final "<code>options</code>"
parameter, which allow the attributes of the new object to be specified
as a comma-separated list of "attribute=value" strings. Each PyAST
wrapper has an equivalent optional string parameter. If the parameter is
omitted, the object attributes will be left at their default values. A
future version of PyAST may allow attributes to be set using the usual
Python approach of an optional set of keyword arguments.

<li> Each AST Object "attribute" (as listed in the C documentation) has a
corresponding Python property with the same name. So for instance, either
of the following can be used to set the "Zoom" attribute (the zoom
factor) in a ZoomMap refered to by "zm":
<p>
<span class=pycode>
>>> zm.set("Zoom=1.2")<br>
>>> zm.Zoom = 1.2
</span>
<p>
Note, some AST attributes are multi-valued, with individual values being
refered to by attribute names of the form "<code>name(index)</code>" (i.e. the
attribute name followed by a numerical of string index in parentheses).
The corresponding Python properties are of the form "<code>name_index</code>"
(i.e.the index is appended with an underscore rather than being enclosed in
parentheses). For instance, either of the following will set the Label
attribute for the second axis of a Frame:
<p>
<span class=pycode>
>>> frm.set("Label(2)=Flux density")<br>
>>> frm.Label_2 = "Flux density"
</span>
<p>
and this will set the colour of a Plot border to colour index 1:
<p>
<span class=pycode>
>>> plot.set("Colour(Border)=1")<br>
>>> Plot.Colour_Border = 1
</span>
<p>

<li> AST attributes can be retrieved using the <code>starlink.Ast.get()</code>
method or the corresponding Python property:
<p>
<span class=pycode>
>>> print( zm.get("Zoom") )<br>
>>> print( zm.Zoom )
</span>

<li> The testing and clearing of AST attributes can only be done using the
<code>starlink.Ast.test()</code> and <code>starlink.Ast.clear()</code>
methods:
<p>
<span class=pycode>
>>> zm.clear("Zoom")<br>
>>> zm.test("Zoom")
</span>
<p>

<li> AST defines many constants. These are referred to in the C documentation
using names of the form <code>AST__xxx</code> (e.g. <code>AST__BAD</code>).
In Python, these constants are available as <code>starlink.Ast.xxx</code>
(e.g. <code>starlink.Ast.BAD</code>).

<li> See section "<a href="node1.html">Implemented AST functions</a>" for
details of the API for all functions provided by PyAST. In general, the
argument lists for PyAST functions and methods are as listed in the C
documentation, except that values returned via supplied pointers are
instead returned as part of the function value. If this means that a
PyAST function returns more than one value, they will be contained within
a tuple. If the C AST function returns a non-void function value, it will
be the first element in the tuple. Any other values returned by the C
function via supplied C pointers will be returned as subsequent elements
of the tuple, in the order in which the C pointers appear in the argument
list of the C function. If the C function does not return any values via
C pointers, then the returned Python value will be a single object
reference rather than a tuple.

<li> In general, the PyAST wrapper for a function will omit arguments that
are present in the C interface if their values can be derived from other
arguments. In particular, if an array or list is supplied as an argument,
the length of the array or list does not need to be supplied using a
separate parameter, as is done in the C interface.

<li>When an array is expected as an argument, a numpy array of floating
point values, or any sequence (lists, tuples, etc.) that can be converted
to a numpy array, should be supplied.

<li> Most methods for which AST provides variants for different data
types (e.g. astRebin, astRebinSeq, astResample, etc) are unified into one
method in the Python interface. The names of such function are the same
as the AST names, but without any final letter indicating the data type
(e.g. astRebinD, astRebinF and astRebinI are replaced by
starlink.Ast.Mapping.rebin). The data type to use is determined from the
supplied array containing the input data.
