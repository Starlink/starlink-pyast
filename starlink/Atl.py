class PyFITSAdapter:
    """

    Adapter to allow PyAST FitsChan objects to read and write headers to
    and from a PyFITS HDU.

    This class allows a PyFITS HDU to be used as the source or sink object
    with a FitsChan.

    When used as a FitsChan source, the PyFITSAdapter will allow the
    FitsChan to read each of the cards in the associated PyFITS header,
    thus allowing the cards to be copied into the FitsChan. This happens
    when the newly created, empty FitsChan is used for the first time
    (i.e. when any of its methods is invoked), and subsequently whenever
    the FitsChan.readfits() method is invoked.

    When used as a FitsChan sink, the PyFITSAdapter will allow the
    FitsChan to copy its own header cards into the PyFITS header. This
    happens when the FitsChan is deleted or when the FitsChan.writefits()
    method is invoked. If the PyFITSAdapter.Clear property is true, then
    the PyFITS header is first emptied of all existing headers, and the
    contents of the FitsChan are then stored in the PyFITS header.  If the
    PyFITSAdapter.Clear property is False, the original contents of the
    PyFITS header are retained. In this case each FitsChan card replaces any
    existing card that refers to the same keyword (if there is no card
    for the keyword already in the PyFITS header, the FitsChan card will
    be appended to the end of the header).

    """

    def __init__(self, hdu, clear=True):
        """
        Construct a PyFITSAdapter for a specified PyFITS HDU.

        Parameters:
           hdu: An element of the hdulist associated with a FITS file
              opened using pyfits.open(). If the entire hdulist is supplied,
              rather than an element of the hdulist, then the primary HDU
              (element zero) will be used.
           clear: This value is only used when using the PyFITSAdapter as
              a sink function with a FitsChan. If "clear" is True, the
              original contents of the PyFITS header are deleted
              immediately before the first FitsChan card is copied into the
              PyFITS header. If "clear" is False, the original contents of
              the PyFITS heasder are retained, with the FitsChan keywords
              over-writing any existing values for the same keywords.
